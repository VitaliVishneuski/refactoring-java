## General Task Guidelines

* If **pipeline definition** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) exists, please **don't** change it.
* Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
* It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
* A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
* While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdpartyjars' should be ignored. These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
* **Unit tests** - Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green.
* **Modifying unit tests** - You can modify tests as long as there is **no change in the behavior (e.g. test assertions)** of the tests. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
